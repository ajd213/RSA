This module is adapted from Eli Bendersky's RSA repository [here](https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2019/rsa). All credit to Eli. I am extending the code in this repo.

See also his [website](https://eli.thegreenplace.net). His excellent blog post [RSA - theory and implementation](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/rsa-theory-and-implementation/) is a great introduction to the topic.
